# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I Worked on Front End Project TwitchTV JSON API

**Thoughts:** Wow, back in the saddle again. It is so hard to remember alot of the programming terminology but it is slowly coming back to me. Still learning the API's and JSON funtionality but it is fun to edit the CSS, learning by making lots of mistakes.

### Day 2: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: My grandmother passed away early this morning. I feel compelled to create a tribute page for her in her honor. I'm working on a Bootstrap  with a Parallax style

**Thoughts** It is really hard to code when I have tear streaming down my face and blurring my vision

### Day 3: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Still working on my Tribute page, it is alot harder to remember 
when all the shortcuts and coding when you haven't done it in a long time. But like riding a bike it is coming back to me.

**Thoughts** This is a very personal and emotional project, I really want to make it nice so it is taking me longer to convey the concept I want to represent if that makes sense
